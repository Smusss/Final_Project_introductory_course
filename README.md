# Final Project - Introductory_course

For the full performance of verification work, it is necessary:
1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Draw a block diagram of the algorithm.
3. Provide a formalized text description of the solution to the repository (file README.md).
4. Write a program that solves the problem.
5. Use version control on this small project.

**Task:**

Write a program that from the existing array of strings forms a new array of strings whose length is less than or equal to 3 characters.
The initial array can be entered from the keyboard, or set at the start of the algorithm execution.
